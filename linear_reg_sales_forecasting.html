			<h3> Forecasting sales can inform the amount of influence various aspects of a business have on
				performance. This knowledge can be used to facilitate data-driven optimizations within business
				tactics, such as demonstrated in the following analysis of Q1 '19 transactional data from 
				3 supermarkets in Mayanmar.
			</h3>
			
			<h3> A linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the influence:
				branch, membership status, day of the week and quantity sold had on the sales
				in the supermarket chain. The results of the analysis can be found in the following workbook:
				<a href="https://github.com/rhiats/Sales-Forcast-Linear-Regression"> Analysis Workbook </a>
				The model in the workbook describes about 80% of the sales variance, with the quantity of products sold
				being the most influencial factor in the analysis.

			<h3> The 3 supermarket branches are in 3 distinct cities: Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyitaw. Irrespective of
				these differences, the 3 branches offer the same 6 products as shown in the image. 
				The differences in product share are minor, but worth mentioning with branch B selling about 40% Health products.
				Overall, it seems like customers are equally likely to buy a product from any of the 3 branch. 
				While the branch and product type may not have a strong change in sales,
				each additional product sold results in $57 of additional sales above the sales of branch C on the weekend, the baseline.
				A potential recommendation is the supermarket chain should prioritize
				the quantity of products sold as opposed to the type of product. 
			</h3>

			<h3> Moving forward, it may be beneficial to add more transactional data to the analysis, to understand information from additional quarters
				as well as additional branches. Currently, the analysis is conducted on branches located in cities with
				various populations, which may have different foot traffic. It would be interesting to include a customer identification
				on the transactions, so the sales could be predicted at a customer level. </h3>
