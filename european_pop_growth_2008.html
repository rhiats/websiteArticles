			<h3> Tableau is used to create the visualization of a symbol map. The data is filtered
				to the most recent date, 2008, and focuses on European countries. The size of the 
				circles shows the population growth with the colors showing the population size. 
				Ireland has a small population of about 4K people, with a high population growth of 
				4%. This is contrasted by the UK, which has a large population of 62K with a low population
				growth of 2%. Both Spain and Ukraine have a population of 46K with Spain's population 
				growing by 3% and Ukraine's declining by 1%.
			</h3>

			<h3> It would be interesting to better understand why these trends emerge in the dataset.
