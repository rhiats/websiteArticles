			<h1> Classification of Heart Failure Replication Project </h1>

			<h3> I found a dataset on UCI Machine Learning that includes data about heart failure. 
				This dataset is discussed in the paper: "Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone," 
				so I decided to replicate the analysis done in this paper in my project using Python. I predict the survival of patients with heart failure using a variety of classifiers.
				I found that the artificial neural network (ANN) performs the best with a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score of about 0.6. I chose to use an MCC score, like the paper, because
				MCC is the works well with class imbalance.      
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 The results of the 
				 analysis can be found in the following workbook:<a href="https://github.com/rhiats/Heart-Failure-Clinical-Records"> 
				Analysis Workbook </a>
				
				I created a dashboard on streamlit to show my visualizations
				 which can be found here:<a href="https://rhiats-heart-failure-clinical-records-app-b68m3z.streamlit.app/"> 
				Dashboard </a>
			</h3>

			<h3> Summary Table of Continuous Full Sample shows the median, mean and standard deviation of continuous variables in the dataset. 
				There are seven continuous features in the dataset. The continuous features: age, ejection_fraction, platelets, serum_creatinine,
				and serum_sodium are symmetrically distributed. This is benificial for training Artificial Neural Networks, especially when the 
				data is standardized. The standard deviation of creatinine phosphokinase is greater than its mean, so 
				it has high variance. The paper does not transform any variables, but it might be interesting to transform
				this variable (using log) to handle the variance.
			</h3>

			<h3>
				Significant Pearson Correlations shows the correlation between continuous variables that have a 
				significance less than 0.05. None of the variables are that significantly linearly correlated. 
				The abscence of multicollinearity reduces redundancy in the model, so the ANN can learn diverse
				independent patterns. The ANN can learn non-linear patterns. 
			</h3>

			<h3>
				Similar to the paper, I used Grid Search to identify the ANN with the highest MCC score. 
				The best performing ANN has a:
				<ul>
					<li>Activation of tanh</li>
					<li>Alpha of 0.0001 (regularization amount on the loss)</li>
					<li>2 hidden layers of size 50</li>
					<li>Constant learning rate</li>
					<li>Stochastic Gradient Descent Solver</li>
				</ul>
