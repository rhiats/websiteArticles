		<div class="content">
			<h3> In 1912 the Titanic, a luxury passenger ship, sank in route from England to the United States. Women and children were evacuated first. Third class passengers did not realize the severity of the situation until it was too late for them to evacuate the ship, so most of those passengers did not survive the catastrophe. </h3>
