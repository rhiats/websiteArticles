			<h1> Modifying the Typical N-gram Feature </h1>

			<h3> Brocardo and team design a supervised learning technique and n-gram analysis approach to predict the probability that documents from the Enron email dataset are written by the same author. </h3>

			<h3> N-grams are a list of characters that have a size of n and are beneficial for stylometry because they obscure the topic of a document (when n is at least 2 and shorter than the length of a word). The team’s n-gram analysis uses n-grams to generate a user profile. </h3>

			<h3> A set of documents written by the same user is divided into 2 groups. The first group is used to create a unique set of n-grams, N, and the second group is split into blocks. The n-grams in each block of the second group are compared to the set of n-grams collected in d1to calculate the ratio of n-grams that overlap N to the size of N. The sample mean and variance of this distribution are used to calculate each user threshold. </h3>

			<h3> A block of a document is considered authored by a user only when the ratio of n-grams that overlap N to the size of Nis greater than the sum of a user threshold and a constant.</h3>

			<h3> The team evaluated the performance of this analysis using the Enron email dataset. The dataset contains 150 authors with an average email length of 200 words. The emails cover a breadth of topics - business communications, technical reports, and personal chats - and vary in grammatical formality making it challenging to attribute a unique style to individual authors. </h3>

			<h3> It is noted that the optimal performance occurred when using an n-gram size of 5. This may be because the model is also detecting other aspects of the documents, like the topic of the email and author’s word choice. </h3>

			<h3> Like the author’s mentioned in the paper, it would be interesting to expand this approach to other features like part of speech and spelling errors. </h3>
