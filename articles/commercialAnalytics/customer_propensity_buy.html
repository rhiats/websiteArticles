			<h3> Website design influences consumer behavior and brand reputation. A polished and user-friendly website encourages users to remain on the website, send links to friends, and purchase products. Obtaining a deeper understanding of consumer behavior is imperitive for business' to design websites that mold potential visitors into actual customers. One method of delving into this commercial questions is through the behavior of website visitors, which reveal trends about the purchasing potential of the consumer. </h3>

			<h3> The website behavior of approximately 455K users on an unspecified webpage is detailed in a dataset on Kaggle. It provides a glipse into the influence of technology in the private sector - a booming area intersection of fields. Amazon, an e-commerce website, recieves 2.5M visitors, who live in the United States, a month. Those visitors may have accounts on the site or be new to the site and these actions influence the purchasing potential of these consumers.

			<h3> Similar to standard programming for software, machine learning algorithms are a tool that aim to efficiently provide a useful output. However, machine learning algorithms are unique, because they are not explicitly programmed to provide a particular response for a given input. The algorithmâ€™s response changes as modifications are made to inputted data because they rely on trends in the dataset. </h3>

			<h3> Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It relies on principles from statistics and computer science and originated from principles in neuroscience, linguistics and logic. As reflected in its applications in a variety of fields, it is a powerful computational tool. </h3>
