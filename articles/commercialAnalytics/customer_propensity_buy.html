			<h3> Machine learning algorithms are prevalent in popular applications. For example, they are used to recommend shows on Netflix, advise financial investing and guide the movements of self-driving cars. </h3>

			<h3> In broad terms, these algorithms use statistics to find patterns in big data. </h3>

			<h3> The datasets may contain the text in a social media post, numerical data on the cost of a stock, or even images of people taken by a security camera. The ability for machine learning algorithms to efficiently provide insights from such a wide range of data increases its utility in fields like healthcare, marketing and cyber security. </h3>

			<h3> Similar to standard programming for software, machine learning algorithms are a tool that aim to efficiently provide a useful output. However, machine learning algorithms are unique, because they are not explicitly programmed to provide a particular response for a given input. The algorithmâ€™s response changes as modifications are made to inputted data because they rely on trends in the dataset. </h3>

			<h3> Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It relies on principles from statistics and computer science and originated from principles in neuroscience, linguistics and logic. As reflected in its applications in a variety of fields, it is a powerful computational tool. </h3>
