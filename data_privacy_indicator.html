			<h3> Third party resources obtain access to user information when used to aid software development and data storage on the Google Drive platform. The Google Drive platform notifies users that their information is shared with third-party applications. However, current notification methods are quotidian and difficult for general users to understand. In an effort to improve the user’s understanding of the privacy concerns surrounding their Google Drive accounts, Harkous, Rahman, and Aberer designed three Data Driven Policy Indicators (DDPIs): immediate insights, far-reaching insights, and history-based insights. The experiments revealed that far-reaching insights tended to perform better than immediate insights because more users prevented third-parties from accessing the data in the Drive. </h3>

			<h3> The responses of 160 participants were used to determine the effectiveness of the immediate insights to the far-reaching insights. The participants are separated into 3 groups: Baseline group, Immediate Insight group, and Far-Reaching Insight group. The baseline group was shown the standard Google Drive notice, the immediate insight group was shown a notice that contained an immediate insight and the far-reaching group was shown a far-reaching insight. The participants could then accept the settings or reject the permission because they found the application too invasive. </h3>

			<h3> The smaller the number of accepts implied that the user understood the privacy warning and felt it was too invasive. Harkous and team considered that a sign that the insight was successful. Far-reaching insights tended to perform better than the baseline and better than the immediate insights. </h3>

			<h3> It may be interesting to explore meausure the individual user's baseline because individual users may have different baselines. The current paper does not include data showing the distribution of the three groups, but rather the interpretation of the data, so it may be interesting to see the results from the experiment. Both the immediate insight and far-reaching insights are personalized to the user’s Drive information and are novel to the user. It may be interesting to observe how users react to these measures after a period of time, when the approaches are no longer novel. </h3>
