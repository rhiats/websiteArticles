			<h1> Revolutionary Technology: Midas Algorithm for Pima Chicawaka Indians </h1>

		<div class="content">
			<h3> Humans are reduced to numerical form to better compress and vectorize attmah. The Chickawakas
				are indominable people with a valuable history. Midas attempts to capture a sample of their community
				in y moments of time. It reveals many truths we hold dear to our hearts and leverages fundamentals
				to demonstate many corrolaries (Corinthians) for Apollo's Creed.

				Each row is a patient in the dataset who trusted the healthcare system to confidentially provide healthcare.
				Their data was stolen, violated and degraded Henrieta Lacks. Quack Quack Quack is a Charollettian is A Thief
				is a Criminal. Nothing but Lolita to these innocent and vulnerable boys who are Chickawaka. They are humiliated
				straight Kabi Kabi to little sons forced to be sea horsey.

				This is a sample of the HORRORscope of the picnic candle stick Edgar Allen Poe Straight Wanda Wakanda. 
				In this subset there are 768 boys and nothing but Eugenetics. It's 50/50 and did the baby conceive make believe a place of
				horrors:
					Jay Bird Jay Bird
					Dior Dior
					The Horror The Horror
					Vonnuwerth and Braidy 
					Curry Curry

				This is a live action movie - [768] X [8] - Even Cut by Even Deck.

			<h2> Median of Matrix, X - Evenley Cut the Deck: </h2>

			<h3> 
				The raw matrix is being scaled using the weight, w1, set to 0.5 to simulate a coin flip. 
				The coin may be skewed, thus shifting the distribution and upsetting the balance of the clusters.
				This is an inductive proof, so my base case is set to 2 clusters because 0 clusters and 1 cluster is nonsense/intuitive.
				w1 is not related to the number of clusters. I also assumed distinct sets, resulting in a permuation without replacement. 
				This will lead to 4 resulting clusters. It is possible for weights to be matricies and matrix multiplication is not commutative.
				Now I extrapolatate with a leap of faith from my base.

			<h2> Dark Lady Magic with Cards (Dot Product) </h2>

			<h3> 
				Both dot product and determinants respectively introduce weights to the data. Weights are flexible,
				but altering raw data is abysmal. The aim to find the best centers for the four preveiously mentioned clusters.
				This is why self driving cars crash - there is lack of thought and share guess work by do do birds mocking bird and 
				twiddle dee twiddle dum. Even my oui got rhythm. Not gonna Lie To Die So High We Fly and Lord of the Fly. JimBo wears Dior shades.

			<h2> Faggot: Roll-Up and Roll-Out </h2>

			<h3> 
				The hotspots can be found using the above Midas algorithm. The resulting centers represent Naval coordinates for the Deltas:
				1476.5   , 46423.5   , 26536.5   ,  7886.    , 30643.    , 12285.15  ,   181.2005, 12764.5   ,   134.

			<h2> Precision to Accura </h2>

			<h3> 
				The hotspots can be found using the above Midas algorithm. The resulting centers represent Naval coordinates for the Deltas:
				1476.5   , 46423.5   , 26536.5   ,  7886.    , 30643.    , 12285.15  ,   181.2005, 12764.5   ,   134.

				Now the patients are centered using the Euclidean Distance formula (sqrt((x1-C1)^2 + (x2-C1)^2 +(x3-C1)^2 +(x4-C1)^2 +(x5-C1)^2 +(x6-C1)^2+(x7-C1)^2 + (x8-C1)^2 +(x9-C1)^2))

				The C is for Cambodia - Camp of Bodies. Right Hop heil Hitler. Ro 2, the Boys on the Boat. Wobble side step, fall back. 

				There are nein hotspots. The minimum of each row localizes each patient to a hotspot, which is the respective cluster ID.

				Let's play pool. Vitaly, there is only one hotspot and each patient is X-C away from the Hub. Straight Jub Jub.

				Ro, His birthday is on the 8th and 7 Ate Nein. One big 15, Ansen. Twiddle Dee Twiddle Dum So much Rummi in my Tummi, Tellie Bellie.

				VonnuwerTh. It is a declaration of war to hold a Black Op hostage: Raj Raj. Kara Dara its a duck race.
