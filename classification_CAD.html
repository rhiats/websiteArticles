			<h1> Classification of Coronary Artery Disease </h1>

			<h3> Coronary heart disease (CAD) is the world's leading cause of death [2]. CAD occurs due to narrowing of the three main coronary blood vessels by atherosclerotic plaques [2]. The dataset, UCI Machine Learning Repository contains a Heart disease dataset that  contains 303 datapoints [5]. Each datapoint contains health data for an individual patient who visited Cleveland Clinic between May
			1981 and September 1984 [2]. This project compares classifiers to classify patients as with CAD or healthy. Previous work used SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, K-NN, and xGBoost, Logistic Regression, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron to classify patients as having CAD or not [1,2,3,4]. Sensitivity and Specificy were used to evaluate the model [2]. For this project, I will compare the performance of a Nonlinear SVM (Kernel SVM), Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron model in classifying patients as healthy or ill.

			<h3> The classes are balanced with 139 patients having heart disease and 164 patients not having heart disease.</h3>

			<h3>
				It is interesting to check if the data is linearly separable, so I checked the linear separabilty mathematically using centroids. To check the linear separability of the two classes (with heart disease or without heart disease), I computed the centroids of each class. Then I calculated the vector between the centroids. This is the Direction vector. The hyperplane that divides the classes is perpendicular to the direction vector and centered at the midpoint of the centroids. I projected each point onto the Direction vector and then checked which side of the midpoint it falls. If the accuracy is high (>80%) then the classes are linearly separable. I only considered continuous features and calculated an accuracy of 54%, so the data is not linearly separable. 
			</h3>

			<h3>
				It is also clear that the classes are not linearly separable as shown in the PCA visualization of the classes.

			<h3>
				There are many potential features in the dataset. There are categorical and continuous features. I conduct Data Analysis of the features to better understand there potential use in models downstream.
			</h3>

			<h3>
				The first feature I evaluate is Age. Age refers to the age of the patient. In the dataset, patients in their 60's tend to have CAD. 27% of 60 year olds have CAD compared to other ages. I conducted a t-test to compare the average age of the healthy and sick and fail to reject the null that the ages are similar between CAD and Healthy patients (p value: 8.96e-05).

			<h3>
				The next feature I compared between the two classes is Sex. I conducted a Chi-Square test of independence and found that sex and health status are not independent (p value: 2.67e-06).
